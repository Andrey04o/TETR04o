How to use it?
1. Find in Prefabs folder a TETR04o prefab and Control settings prefab. Put them to your world.
2. Attach in the "TETR04o" prefab, in a "TetrisMain" gameobject a "Hotkeys" variable from a "Hotkeys" gameobject of the "Controls settings" prefab.

Yes, it's not comfortably. It will be fixed in future.
